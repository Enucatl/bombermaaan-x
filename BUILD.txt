HOW TO BUILD

Currently, I only know how to build the game for Linux and Mac OS X.

It looks like there are some further instructions in the docs/ directory, but I'm going to write these up here anyway for my (michaelbarlow7) own sake.

These were derived from the original instructions here: http://bombermaaan.sourceforge.net/doxydoc/html/compileinstructions.html

LINUX

- Install SDL and SDL_mixer development libraries. Should be able to do this via your package manager
-- e.g. "sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev"

- Clone my repo.
-- e.g. "git clone https://github.com/michaelbarlow7/bombermaaan-x.git"
-- This includes all image and sound resources

- Change to the src/ directory and type "make"

- Change to src/bombermaaan/ and ensure the "run-bm" shell script is executable.
-- "chmod +x run-bm"

- Run this to run bombermaaan.
-- "./run-bm"

MAC

- Install SDL and SDL_mixer development libraries. I used homebrew for this. You'll need libmikmod and libvorbis for the .s3m and .ogg files respectively.
-- "brew install SDL", "brew install SDL_mixer --with-libmikmod --with-libvorbis"

- Clone my repo.
-- e.g. "git clone https://github.com/michaelbarlow7/bombermaaan-x.git"
-- This includes all image and sound resources

- Change to the src/ directory and type "make"

- Change to src/bombermaaan/ and ensure the "run-bm" shell script is executable.
-- "chmod +x run-bm"

- Run this to run bombermaaan.
-- "./run-bm"

WINDOWS
- Coming soon...hoping to use gcc via MinGW and MSYS instead of Microsoft's C++ compiler (which I think it was using before). This would make the code a lot cleaner and easier to work with.
